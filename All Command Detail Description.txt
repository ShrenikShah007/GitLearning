==> Why GIT?
    Git is used for version control and also to track file version based on changes. It also helps developer to work multiple person on same module without conflicting each others code.We can also rollback to previous version. 
    (Files tracking is a responsibility of Developers)

==> Features of GIT
    It will strore all files in snapshot format not differecnce inside .git folder. 
    (All files version control will be handled using .git folder)
    Almost every operations aare local until it saves and commited to remote repository.
    Git has integrity (We can check file changes using checksum)

==> Git Three Stage Structure
    1) Local working environment
    2) Staging (Which files ready for commits)
    3) Git Directory (Repository Actually commited files)

==> Git Files status lifecycle
    1) Untracked (it will create untracked when git init execute)
    2) Unmodified (git add --a)
    3) Modified (git add .)
    4) Staged (git Commit -m "Message")

==> GitIgnore file Importance
   The command "touch.gitignore" allows us to create a single file. We can include any files or folders in the git ignoreÂ file that we do not want to be tracked.

==> Command:: pwd
    Present Working Directory

==> Command::  git config --global user.name
    Set username & email using above command

==> Command::  git status
    status of current branch or repository

==> Command::  git add --a   
    It will add all files and folder to staging area or ready for commits

==> Command::  git log   
    It will list down all the commited message with user info and commit message.

==> Command::  rm -rf .git   
    It will remove .git folder repository.

==> Command::  git Clone SSh_url   
    It will pull all the data of remote repository to local machine using above command.

==> Command::  git diff   
    It will compare content between staging directory and working directory.

==> Command::  git diff --staged  
    It will compare content between last commit with current staging.
